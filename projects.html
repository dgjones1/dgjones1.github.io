		  <li>Relationship Between El Nino-Southern Oscillation and Wildfires in the Western United States, Spring 2022: I analyzed drought conditions in the western US during the 2010-2011 La Nina and 2015-2016 El Nino events. Using GrADS software, I plotted temperature and precipitation anomalies. An example of one of my plots can be seen on the right.  </li>
		  <li>Effect of Climate Change on Tropical Cyclone Translation Speed, Spring 2022: I plotted and analyzed tropical cyclone translation speed data over the last century and discussed possible impacts on storm surge and flooding along the NC coast. </li>
		  <li>Remnants of Hurricane Ida - Tornado Outbreak Case Study, Spring 2022: I studied the environmental conditions that supported the development of a tornadic supercell in Mullica Hill, NJ. Using Python code, I plotted radar reflectivity and radial velocity. </li>
		  <li>Micrometeorological Fluxes at North Carolina Clearcut Site, Spring 2022: I analyzed energy balance, flux footprint dispersion and seasonal changes in carbon dioxide and latent heat fluxes at NC clearcut (US-NC1) site. My energy balance plot can be seen on the right. </li>
		  <li>Spatial Analysis of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and United States Wintertime Precipitation, Spring 2020: Using data from <a href="https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models">NCARâ€™s CESM1-CAM4</a> model, I created MATLAB code to analyze variations in sea surface temperature (SST) and precipitation anomalies during different phases of PDO. To the right (botttom) is a plot that I created to show November-March SST anomalies during a positive PDO. </li>
		  <li>Radar Proposal, Fall 2020: I collaborated with group members to create a radar proposal for the National Weather Service in San Juan, Puerto Rico. We considered topography and storm climatology to determine the most effective radar hardware, scan strategy, and dual polarization variables. </li>
