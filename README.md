The repository I created includes website files for my professional website. 
I first created a repository "dgjones1.github.io", then I clicked the "+" icon in the top left
corner on the github desktop and selected "Clone a repository". I then selected the 
"dgjones1.github.io" repository. Lastly, I added my website files to the repository on my local
machine.
